# Introduction to the project
Welcome to VehicleSG a one-stop platform to serve the needs and requirements of Singapore motorists as well as educate them on road safety and driving rules in an interractive quiz

 
## Design Process
 
As a team we first thought about what features would be useful for motorists and came up with a selection of ideas such as a COE tracker, carpark availability search, Live updates
from TUAS and WOODLANDS Checkpoint as well as the current traffic flow and conditions on the road as seen through our Idea Brief. 

We utilised the web application Figma as it allows for ease of integration and is readily accessible for collaborative works compared to Adobe XD as well as a plethora of plugins
to aid in the design process of the low fidelity wireframes

Here is the link to our figma wireframe: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/KfDpdyELxdICHP7zi0SLYd/VehicleSG?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=c263ky6W2egumvHc-1)






## Features

After deliberating we managed to come up with 3 features which we believe are essential in culvating road readiness andd well informed motorists

 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - Allow motorists to get real time lots available through searching in the input field in carpark availability page
- Feature 2 - Allow motorists to view real time checkpoint conditions 
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
